## Quantum Chess

We start off with normal chess rules. But for every piece you move you
have move it to two places, ending up with two copies of the same
piece. We continue like this and end up with multiple copies of the
same piece.

If a piece takes or gets taken by another piece it collapses so that
only that copy remains (or none of them, if it got taken.)
